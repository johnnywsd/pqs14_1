For this assignment you will implement an address book library.  Users of your address book library should be able to do the following.

* Create an empty address book.

* Add an entry.  An entry consists of a name, postal address, phone number, email address, and a note.

* Remove an entry.

* Search for an entry by any of the contact properties.

* Save the address book to a file.

* Read the address book from a file.

Remember the items we discussed in class.  Make all methods as short and private as possible.  Clarity and readability are more important than efficiency.  You must use javadocs for all your public classes and methods.

You will find a PS1 eclipse project in your repository.  Check out the project and commit your changes as you make them.

Please send any questions to the class mailing list.
